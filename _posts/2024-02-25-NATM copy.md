# Individual Final

## What is our Project:
We created a simple chatbox/social media website to connect people together. With the rise of social media as a whole, we realized that many social media applications promote false information and unrealistic standards of living. Our goal was to show people who they are with a chatbox, that only involves posting, reply, edit, and likes. This allows people to communicate on ideas that they find interesting.

## My Feature
1. **Reply**
 - My feature is a reply feature that allows people to reply to previously made posts. It clearly shows as a reply underneath the posts, and is able to be liked and edited. It also acts as its own standalone section to the page.
## Code + CPT Requirements added.

| Requirement | Code/Work |
|----------|----------|
| Instructions for input from one of the following: the user, a device, an online datas stream, a file.(Ours will take input from a user) | Our project takes text data from a user and is shown as either a post or reply in the main dashboard. |
| Use of at least one list (or other collection type) to represent a collection of
data that is stored and used to manage program complexity and help fulfill
the program’s purpose | Our information is stored into the backend repository where every message/reply that is sent is updated into the table. This is useful for us as a user will be able to reply to a previously sent message|
| At least one procedure that contirubted to the program’s intened purpose where you have defined: the name, return type, one or more parameters:	 | Row 3, Col 2 |
| An algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration that is in the body of the selected procedure	 | Sequencing through the list of messages |
