# Individual Final

## What is our Project:
We created a simple chatbox/social media website to connect people together. With the rise of social media as a whole, we realized that many social media applications promote false information and unrealistic standards of living. Our goal was to show people who they are with a chatbox, that only involves posting, reply, edit, and likes. This allows people to communicate on ideas that they find interesting.

## My Feature
1. **Reply**
    - My feature is a reply feature that allows people to reply to previously made posts. It clearly shows as a reply underneath the posts, and is able to be liked and edited. It also acts as its own standalone section to the page.

## Code + CPT Requirements added.

| Requirement | Code/Work |
|-------------|-----------|
| Instructions for input from one of the following: the user, a device, an online data stream, a file. (Ours will take input from a user) | Our project takes text data from a user and is shown as either a post or reply in the main dashboard. |
| Use of at least one list (or other collection type) to represent a collection of data that is stored and used to manage program complexity and help fulfill the program’s purpose | Our information is stored into the backend repository where every message/reply that is sent is updated into the table. This is useful for us as a user will be able to reply to a previously sent message|
| At least one procedure that contributed to the program’s intended purpose where you have defined: the name, return type, one or more parameters | The _Send function contributes to the program's intended purpose of handling replies, where it creates instances of the Reply classes and calls their create methods. <img src="https://github.com/aashrayr/student2/assets/68722712/59905cbe-645d-4c76-8dbe-6fb0997b3084" alt="Your Image" width="1600">
|
| An algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration that is in the body of the selected procedure | The create method sequentially adds the current instance to the database session, commits the changes to the database, and returns the current instance, facilitating the persistence of the object in the database. <img src="https://github.com/aashrayr/student2/assets/68722712/aec42345-95a0-40fd-a6ac-7d135e3c73be" alt="image" width="800">|
| Calls to your student-developed procedure | Calling the reply function to reply to the original <img src="https://github.com/aashrayr/student2/assets/68722712/cbf61361-f194-4652-a711-e63b8de319a3" alt="image" width="800">|
| Instructions for output (tactile, audible, visual, or ) based on input and program functionality | Fetch function that eventually displays the reply into the main dashboard. <img src="https://github.com/aashrayr/student2/assets/68722712/24571333-519e-410c-9d14-20d95819fe94" alt="image" width="800">|
