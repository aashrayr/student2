# My Journey in Coding and Teamwork

## Introduction of Key Interests and How Coding Intersects with Those Interests

From a young age, I've been fascinated by technology and its potential to solve real-world problems. My key interests lie in software development, machine learning, and full-stack web development. These interests intersect seamlessly with coding, as it is the fundamental skill that allows me to create, innovate, and implement solutions. Whether it's developing web applications, creating algorithms, or analyzing data, coding has always been at the heart of my projects.

## Full Stack Coding Experience

My full-stack coding experiences include several diverse and dynamic projects:

- **Music Finder and Adder**: A program that allows users to add songs along with their full lyrics. This project involved creating a user-friendly interface and implementing a robust backend to handle song data and lyrics.
- **Social Media Website**: A platform similar to Twitter where users can post updates, follow other users, and interact through likes and comments. I worked on both front-end design using React.js and back-end functionality with Node.js and Express.
- **Video Platform**: A site featuring video content with functionalities for likes, comments, and a game scoring system. This project required integrating video streaming capabilities and designing a scalable architecture to handle user interactions and game scoring.
- **Anime Rating Lister**: A web application where users can rate and review anime series. I focused on developing a responsive front-end and ensuring that user ratings and reviews were stored and retrieved efficiently using a NoSQL database.

## Overview of Machine Learning Experience

My machine learning experience includes working on various projects that involve data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. I am proficient in Python and have used libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and Scikit-learn to develop and deploy models. My work spans supervised and unsupervised learning, deep learning, and natural language processing. Notable projects include:

- **Predictive Analytics Model**: Developed for customer churn prediction, this project involved building and fine-tuning models to identify customers likely to leave a telecom company.
- **Image Classification**: Created a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images with high accuracy, demonstrating my ability to work with complex deep learning models.
- **NLP Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzed the sentiment of customer reviews using a recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) layers, showcasing my skills in natural language processing.

Our project was the titanic project, where we added additions to the titanic base, and added the ability to find probabilities of survival with different types of features, in addition to the original. 

## GitHub Project and Profile Review

You can find my projects and contributions on my GitHub profile: [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/aashrayr). Some highlights include:

- **Music Website**: [Organization Link](https://github.com/APCSP-RAGS)
- **Social Media**: [Organization Link](https://github.com/SAAK-APCSP)
- **Trimester 3 Projects**: [Organization Link](https://github.com/Project-MKAAT)

## Showcasing Projects

I have had the opportunity to showcase these projects at various events, including the N@tM (Night at the Museum) in May 2024. During these events, we presented our work to a large and diverse audience through live demos, poster sessions, and interactive Q&A segments. Attendees from various backgrounds and interests were able to interact with our applications and provide valuable feedback. This experience not only helped us refine our projects but also enhanced our communication and presentation skills.

## Demo of My Favorite Project

My favorite project is the **Social Media Website**. Hereâ€™s a brief demo:

1. **Homepage**: Displays recent posts from users.
2. **Post Creation**: Users can create new posts.
3. **User Interaction**: Users can like, comment on posts
4. **Reply**: Each user has the ability to reply to posts that they wish to reply to.

You can view the live demo during the interview to get a comprehensive understanding of the functionalities and user experience.

## N@TM
I was involved with helping with the quick sort algorithm, and the GetSorted functions. I was also involved with formatting the frontend, which we used previous templates to make the tiles. 

## Additional Interests

Beyond full-stack development and machine learning, I am also deeply interested in Biomedical Engineering. I am actively learning more about the intersection of ML and biomedical applications. Additionally, I have some experience with R programming, which I am expanding as part of my learning journey. This unique combination of skills and interests positions me well to tackle interdisciplinary challenges and innovate in various fields.

## Unique Qualification

What sets me apart is my ability to seamlessly integrate my technical skills with strong teamwork and communication capabilities. I not only bring a deep understanding of full-stack development and machine learning but also a proven track record of successfully collaborating in diverse teams to deliver high-quality projects. My passion for continuous learning and adaptability to new technologies ensures that I am always ready to tackle the next challenge.
