### Team

*As our team, our priority will be producing working code for a finished product. We will make small goals and try to tackle a project one step at a time. *

>As a Team, make your own 3 to 5 lines Team manifesto. Share it in your next Team review for extra 'indicators'.

### Individual

1. What would you code given absolute freedom? *If I had absolute freedom, I would want to code methods to store more information that I am exposed to everyday. (E.g. Sometimes I read a lot of books, but after two weeks I forget 99% of the content). Basically, I would want to create a "Second Brain" to help me store information and make connections betweent them. (And also making it user friendly)."*
2. What would motivate you to be productive each day given the freedom to code what you want? *I would make sure to have set goals (e.g. by using a calendar, todo list, etc.) so everyday I have bitesized goals to tackle and I don't become overwhelmed by the entire project.*
3. How would you measure success in your team? *I would measure success by how often we meet our goals. (If we are meeting are goals, we are probably productive and focused.) However, we can't always match our expectations, so even if we miss a few deadlines, overtime we'll learn how much work we can handle at a time and get better and managing our tasks and time.* 
4. In a project, most students are more motivated if the project seems useful, unique, and has an interested consumer. How will you maintain motivation? *I would focus on short-term goals, as little milestones maintain motivation as one can see the progess. (One big milestone at the end doesn't show the small steps taken).*
