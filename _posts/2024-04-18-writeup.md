The first image is the get request and this will get the users from the database, prepares the output in JSON, and returns it.

The post request using self is for reading the user and for creating the user. It sets the UID and sets the email while checking if either field is valid (long enough and that it’s not missing or faked). And then it adds it to the database. This is also an example of data validation because it’s ensuring that the email and username are valid.

The update method allows you to add likes or dislikes to the video. It will update the database based on the id type.
