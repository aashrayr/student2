The first image is of our SQLITE database. The table displayes the user, their details and the messages.


Lists and Dictionaries

This image is from the user query function which will query all the users using a get request. It returns the users and each user item will have information

The first image is the get request and this will get the users from the database, prepares the output in JSON, and returns it.

The post request using self is for reading the user and for creating the user. It sets the UID and sets the email while checking if either field is valid (long enough and that it’s not missing or faked). And then it adds it to the database. This is also an example of data validation because it’s ensuring that the email and username are valid.

The update method allows you to add likes or dislikes to the video. It will update the database based on the id type.

Postman Stuff

The following is the get request which is formatted. It is displayed in a table format.

This code is what is behind the GET request and obtains the array of objects. It will fetch every user and will use JSON to display them in the users table. This code also does iteration to append each element.
