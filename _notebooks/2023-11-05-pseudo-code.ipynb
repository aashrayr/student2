    "\n",
    "*Description:*\n",
    "This example demonstrates how to calculate the average of three numbers in pseudocode style. Each step is explained in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Pseudocode:*\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Step 1: Input three numbers\n",
    "num1 = input(\"Enter the first number: \")\n",
    "num2 = input(\"Enter the second number: \")\n",
    "num3 = input(\"Enter the third number: \")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 2: Calculate the sum\n",
    "sum = num1 + num2 + num3\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 3: Calculate the average\n",
    "average = sum / 3\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*Notes:*\n",
    "- Input is taken for three numbers using the `input` function.\n",
    "- The sum of the three numbers is calculated and stored in the `sum` variable.\n",
    "- The average is computed by dividing the sum by 3 and stored in the `average` variable.\n",
    "- Finally, the average is displayed to the user.\n",

    "This example shows how to find the maximum of two numbers using pseudocode. The steps are explained along with the pseudocode.\n",

    "- The `if` statement is used to compare `a` and `b`, and the maximum is printed accordingly.\n",
